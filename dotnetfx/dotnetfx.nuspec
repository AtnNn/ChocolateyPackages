    <summary>The .NET Framework is a development platform for building apps for web, Windows, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Microsoft Azure.</summary>
    <description>The .NET Framework is a development platform for building apps for web, Windows, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Microsoft Azure. It consists of the common language runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework class library, which includes a broad range of functionality and support for many industry standards.

The .NET Framework provides many services, including memory management, type and memory safety, security, networking, and application deployment. It provides easy-to-use data structures and APIs that abstract the lower-level Windows operating system. You can use a variety of programming languages with the .NET Framework, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic. 

.NET Framework 4.7.2 is the next version of the .NET Framework. This release is feature complete and in the testing phase but is not supported for production use. The current Early Access build number being shared is 3052.

This pre-release build 3052 includes improvements in several areas:

* [ASP.NET] Support for SameSite cookie in ASP.NET
* [ASP.NET] Support for ASP.NET Dependency Injection
* [ClickOnce] Per-monitor support for WPF and HDPI-aware VSTO apps deployed via ClickOnce
* [SQL] Always Encrypted enhancements in SQL Connectivity
* [Networking &amp; BCL] Enhanced .NET Framework support for .NET Standard 2.0
* [BCL] Cryptography improvements
* [WPF] Diagnostic enhancements

You can see the complete list of improvements in this build in the [release notes](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-framework-early-access/tree/master/release-notes/build-3052/readme.md).

The .NET Framework build 3052 will replace any existing .NET Framework 4 and later installation on your machine. This means all .NET Framework 4 and later applications on your machine will run on the .NET Framework early access builds upon installation. The .NET Framework build 3052 installs on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Windows 10 Creators Update, Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Windows 8.1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 OS platforms. .NET Framework build 3052 is also included in the next update for Windows 10.
