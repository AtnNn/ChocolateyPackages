### Overview

Visual Studio Enterprise "15" Preview 5 is an early build of the next major release of Visual Studio. Preview provides early adopters with an opportunity to try out the new and improved product features, and the ability to share feedback with the product team.

**PLEASE NOTE**: This preview has not been subject to final validation and is not meant to be run on production workstations or servers.

**DISCLAIMER**: The package id is just an educated guess based on the naming of the Web Platform Installer product VWDOrVs2017AzurePack - Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET (VS "15" Preview). There is no official confirmation that Visual Studio "15" will be released in 2017 or that it will be named Visual Studio 2017.

To find out what's new in Visual Studio "15" Preview 5, or to see the known issues, see the [Visual Studio "15" Preview 5 release notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs15-relnotes).

### Customizations

This release uses the new Visual Studio installer, which does not support customizations yet.

### Installation notes

**IMPORTANT**: This release uses the new Visual Studio installer, which does not support unattended installation yet. Therefore, the installation of this page will require user interaction.

A reboot will most certainly be required after installing/uninstalling this package. A reboot might even be required _before_ installing/uninstalling - if the system is awaiting a reboot due to Windows updates having been installed, or if you are attempting to uninstall the package immediately after installing it. The package will provide informative messages in each case.

If complete control over reboots is required, such as in automation scenarios, it is advisable to install the dependencies (esp. dotnet4.6 or later) first, perform a reboot if necessary, and only after that proceed to install this package.

The installation/uninstallation will take a fair amount of time and on slower systems may exceed the default Chocolatey execution timeout (45 minutes). Use the --execution-timeout argument of choco.exe to increase that timeout.
