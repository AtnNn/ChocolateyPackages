### Overview

Visual Studio Enterprise "15" Preview is an early build of the next major release of Visual Studio. Preview provides early adopters with an opportunity to try out the new and improved product features, and the ability to share feedback with the product team.

**PLEASE NOTE**: This preview has not been subject to final validation and is not meant to be run on production workstations or servers.

**DISCLAIMER**: The package id is just an educated guess based on the naming of the Web Platform Installer product VWDOrVs2017AzurePack - Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET (VS "15" Preview). There is no official confirmation that Visual Studio "15" will be released in 2017 or that it will be named Visual Studio 2017.

To find out what's new in Visual Studio "15" Preview, see the [Visual Studio "15" Preview release notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs15-preview-vs). For a list of fixed bugs and known issues, see the [Visual Studio "15" Preview MSDN Article](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=747840).

### Customizations
You can customize the installation either by adding optional available features or by specifying own installation configuration file.

#### Adding optional features
Optional features (C++, SQL tools, phone tools, etc.) are available but not installed by default.
You can provide optional parameters to include them during the install.
Here is an example that includes the SQL Tools and Windows 10 Mobile Emulators:

    choco install visualstudio2017enterprise -packageParameters "--Features SQLV1,Win10_EmulatorV1"

Due to the package description length limit, the feature codes are listed in the features.txt file in the package.

#### Using own configuration file
Specifying the optional features above modifies the configuration file used during installation (AdminDeployment.xml). If that is not enough you can provide this file on your own. A default file is included in the package.
Examples:

    choco install visualstudio2017enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile c:\path to your\AdminDeployment.xml"
    choco install visualstudio2017enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile http://path/to/your/AdminDeployment.xml"

#### Providing a product key
It is also possible to provide a product key via packageParameters:

    choco install visualstudio2017enterprise -packageParameters "--ProductKey 12345-ABCDE-67890-FEDBC-76543"

#### Full customization example:

    choco install visualstudio2017enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile c:\path to your\AdminDeployment.xml --Features SQLV1,Win10_EmulatorV1 --ProductKey 12345-ABCDE-67890-FEDBC-76543"

### Installation notes
A reboot will most certainly be required after installing/uninstalling this package. A reboot might even be required _before_ installing/uninstalling - if the system is awaiting a reboot due to Windows updates having been installed, or if you are attempting to uninstall the package immediately after installing it. The package will provide informative messages in each case.

On some systems with older .NET 4.x versions, the installation of .NET 4.6.2 (via netfx-4.6.2-devpack) might put the system in such a state that the Visual Studio installer will reboot the computer (ignoring the /NoRestart switch) and set itself up to automatically resume the installation after the user logs back on. This behavior has been observed on Windows 8.1 with .NET 4.5.2.
If complete control over reboots is required, such as in automation scenarios, it is advisable to install the dependencies (esp. netfx-4.6.2-devpack) first, perform a reboot if necessary, and only after that proceed to install this package.

The installation/uninstallation will take a fair amount of time and on slower systems may exceed the default Chocolatey execution timeout (45 minutes). Use the --execution-timeout argument of choco.exe to increase that timeout.
